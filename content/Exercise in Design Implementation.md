When I sat down to begin working on my personal website, I became fascinated with what its design would look like. What would the content width be? Would there be lots of links? How long should a typical blog post be?

What I found was, this website was more of an opportunity for those details to evolve. I could iterate on the design, the code, and the tools I used. The unchanging aspect would be the type of content. Content that clearly communicated and content that spoke to readers eloquently. That would be the constant.

For now, I have chosen a more minimalistic design. In some ways, the design embodies the philosophy of what I want this site to be. As Leo Babauta mentions on his website, there should be an emphasis and focus on content. I think this is a great concept. Too many times we find it hard to focus on the content contained in the original article/link that we navigated to, because there are other aspects of the website that are more prominent and on display as well. With a centralized location for content, you can communicate your ideas and concepts more clearly.

I will be blogging about different topics, but one of the topics I would like to be writing about is programming and code. I think when you learn a concept, and try to teach it to others, you benefit from a better understanding yourself. I have built websites before, but this is really the first of this kind that I have done myself.
