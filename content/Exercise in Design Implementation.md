Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Darshan Prasad. I am a software engineer and web enthusiast living in the San Francisco Bay Area. I started this website as a personal project and learning opportunity. 

From a software engineering perspective, this project provides me with the opportunity to implement a full web application stack from scratch. I can design and tweak the user interface, while also changing how the site receives and responds to user requests. I am also excited to use this website as an avenue to experiment with new computing and web technologies. I plan to write articles about my experience working with new frameworks, libraries, the works - and sharing some of the neat components that can be built using them.

Aside from further developing my skillset as a software engineer, I also hope to write content related to personal growth. I do enjoy the writing process, and appreciate the clarity it provides in exercises of reflection. Therefore, you may see articles related to personal insight alongside technical posts about software and programming.

This website is very much a work in progress and will continue undergoing active development. If you experience issues, want to send some feedback, or simply want to get in touch, your message is always welcome via e-mail: dprasad [at] gmail. Thank you again for stopping by!
